// kf8253_leland_bus -- bus-decode wrapper adapting this repo's generic
// access/ack/wr_en/bytesel bus convention (the same one i186_periph.sv
// uses on its sys-side port) onto vendored KF8253's native
// chip_select_n/read_enable_n/write_enable_n/address[1:0] strobe bus
// (WP5 of docs/planning_80186_sound.md).
//
// Scope boundary (per the plan's WP5/WP6 split): this module does NOT
// decode a real system address into "is this access for me" -- that's
// WP6's PCS-window job (leland_a.cpp's peripheral_r/w, `select = offset
// >> 6`, PCS2/PCS3 sub-windows). This module assumes it has already
// been selected (`access` asserted) and only needs `local_addr[1:0]`
// (the KF8253 register select: 00/01/10 = counter 0/1/2, 11 = control
// -- confirmed against WP0's real observed programming, see
// docs/WP5_PROGRESS.md) to talk to the chip correctly.
//
// Why a 2-cycle FSM, not a 1-cycle passthrough: KF8253_Control_Logic's
// write commit is edge-triggered on write_enable_n's 0->1 transition
// while chip_select_n stays low (`write_flag = ~prev_write_enable_n &
// write_enable_n`, both sampled on `negedge clock`) -- a single-cycle
// `write_enable_n` pulse that only ever *starts* low never produces
// the rising edge the chip is actually watching for. Reads are level-
// sensitive and would work in 1 cycle, but this module uses the same
// 2-cycle shape for both directions for simplicity/symmetry.

// "real bugs found" #3) -- caught here by inspection before it needed
// a debug session to find, since it's structurally identical.
