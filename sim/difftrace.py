"""
Structural diff between our sim's raw PC trace and MAME's real captured
execution trace, to find the first point where our RTL's control flow
diverges from real hardware.

Real traces (docs/reference/mame/traces/mastertrace.log, slavetrace.log)
are MAME debugger `trace` output: one "XXXX: mnemonic" line per executed
instruction, with repeated loops compressed to a single
"(loops for N instructions)" marker instead of literally repeating N
times. Our own traces (sim/master_pc_trace.log, slave_pc_trace.log) are
raw addresses tapped directly off the tv80 core's internal PC register,
one per instruction boundary, fully uncompressed.

Comparing these directly is apples-to-oranges (one is compressed, one
isn't, and loop iteration counts will legitimately differ between a
real board and our sim due to timing differences). So instead of trying
to expand MAME's compression byte-for-byte, this reduces BOTH sides to
a "structural" sequence -- consecutive repeats of the same short cycle
collapsed to one instance -- and diffs THAT. This is robust to
iteration-count differences and highlights the first place where our
sim visits a genuinely different address/region than real execution
ever did.
